title: CSV Converter
---
<p>This is a converter dedicated to the CSV. It started as simply a CSV to JSON converter, but recently I added the ability to go back again, and added a JSON to CSV converter.</p>
<center>
<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="75%">
  <tr>
    <td style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; text-align:center; width:50%;">
      <a href="csv-to-json.html">CSV, to {"JSON"}</a>      
    </td>
    <td style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; text-align:center; width:50%;">
      <a href="json-to-csv.html">{"JSON"} to CSV</a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>As a programmer, my goal is to convert as many Excel and CSV files as I can to JSON, but I can understand that there are many data stewards out there who would rather have their data as CSV and Excel or Google Doc files.</p>
