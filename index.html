<h1>CSV / JSO Converter</h1>
<p>I wanted to make a stand-alone CSV conversion tool that would run exclusively on Github, allowing anyone to fork, upload and manage their open data via simple web interface.</p>

<p>This project runs as a Github Page, building on a Github Repository and is built entirely in JavaScript, which means there is no server backend beyond Github. This allows you to fork and implement without launching your website or servers.</p>

<p>I found a really cool, open source CSV converter called <a href="http://shancarter.github.io/mr-data-converter/">Mr. Data Converter</a>. I used this as the base and engineered it to run on Github Pages, then added the ability to login using Github oAuth and save CSV, JSON and XML files locally to the master Github repository behind CSV Converter.</p>

<p>This is a work in progress, so <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/csv-converter/blog/">follow the blog for updates</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/csv-converter/issues">leave an issue</a> if there is something you need.</p>
