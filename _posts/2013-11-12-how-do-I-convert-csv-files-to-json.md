When you ask many of people in government to open up data, the chances it will come as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet is pretty high. People just speak Microsoft Excel. It is the closest thing they know to being machine readable by default.

If you want users to be able to make their "open data" machine readable, you have to request data in a CSV format. If a user cannot learn how to export an Excel worksheet as CSV, they probably aren't your target audience. If they do, you need to help them understand the difference between CSV, XML and JSON.

To help accomplish this process I created CSV Converter. I found the really cool open source project Mr. Data Converter, and it seemed like the perfect tool for educating users about the difference between CSV, XML and JSON.  Using the entirely JavaScript tool you could paste in a CSV file and easily convert to HTML, XML and JSON, quickly seeing the differences.

Of course, to truly understand the difference you need to be able to put each of these formats to use. This is whats next, allow users to not just convert, but manage their open data in any of these formats.
